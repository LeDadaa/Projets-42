"""Grading one written answer: limits, verdict, explanation, persistence

attempt, then streams the explanation, as NDJSON lines the front reads with
`fetch`. When no model can grade (switched off, over budget, unreachable) it
falls back to self-assessment instead of failing: the student reads the
reference explanation and says whether they had it right
