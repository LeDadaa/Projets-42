"""Domain enums

VARCHAR + CHECK constraint
via `sa.Enum(..., native_enum=False, create_constraint=True)`, not native types ENUM PostgreSQL.
Same validation, but can add or delete a value in a migration,
while native ENUM impose `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` makes impossible deleting without recreating type

`create_constraint=True` is not optional : it defaults to False since SQLAlchemy 1.4,
and without it `native_enum=False` degrades to a plain VARCHAR with no validation at all

Cost: alembic autogenerate does not detect CHECK constraint changes
Adding a value to an enum produces an empty migration ; the drop/recreate of the
constraint has to be written by hand
