"""Realtime channel: presence, plus a thin relay for chat side-signals

One socket per browser tab, authenticated the same way as REST calls (the
`access_token` cookie). nginx already proxies the upgrade at `/api/ws`.

The socket never carries anything the REST API cannot rebuild: presence
transitions and "is typing" hints only. Messages themselves are stored by
`POST /api/v1/chat/messages` and pushed from there.
